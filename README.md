# Tech Career Depot
___

**DESCRIPTION:**
This is an app that will help users to understand tech career options and begin the research process for which roles might best fit their interests. It will also offer the user a roadmap for getting started, salary expectations a few other resources.
 
As someone who is personally transitioning, I think this could be a useful tool to help people get info and answers to questions about multiple careers in one place and sort of see the big picture for each one. 

**TECHNOLOGIES:**
* **GitHub**
**EJS**
* ***HTML 5**
* **CSS**
* **MongoDB**
* **Express**
* **Node**
* **Heroku**


**FEATURES:** 
* **Info on Tech Careers** - There is an individual section for each career displaying a brief description of the career.  In the future there will be a functioning link to the career's mainpage which includes descritpions, common traits or characteristics that go well with the role, a road map for getting started and the national average salary for junior, mid-level and senior level professionals and a few links to resources that may help the user obtain further information. (Eventually there will be more than 3 career choices.)
* **Saved Career List**  - Users have the ability to add a career of their own that tto a list so they can revisit it at a later time.  (Eventually users will have to log in to access this option. They will also have the abity to add and store notes.)
